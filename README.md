# Managing-Big-Data-with-MySQL

I learned how 'Big Data' interacts with business, and how to use data analytics to create value for businesses. I understand how relational databases work and how they are used in business analysis. 

I am able to 
* (1) Describe the structure of relational databases; 
* (2) Interpret and create entity-relationship diagrams and relational schemas that describe the contents of specific databases; 
* (3) Write queries that retrieve and sort data that meet specific criteria, and retrieve such data from real MySQL and Teradata business databases that contain over 1 million rows of data; 
* (4) Execute practices that limit the impact of your queries on other coworkers; 
* (5) Summarize rows of data using aggregate functions, and segment aggregations according to specified variables; 
* (6) Combine and manipulate data from multiple tables across a database; 
* (7) Retrieve records and compute calculations that are dependent on dynamic data features; 
* (8) Translate data analysis questions into SQL queries that accommodate the types of anomalies found in real data sets. 

I have a clear understanding of how relational databases work and have this portfolio of queries as example. Businesses are collecting increasing amounts of information with the hope that data will yield novel insights into how to improve businesses. Analysts that understand how to access this data – this means me! – will have a strong competitive advantage in this data-smitten business world.
